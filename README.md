# Whatsapp-Autoreply-Bot
This is a 'Whatsapp Autoreply Bot' that I made using Python.
This Bot scans a small block of chat as input to observe the chatting behaviour of the user. The code under 'get_curser.py' does this job.
After Studying the behaviour of chatting of user it interacts with the sender as the user itself.
To study and understand this behavioural patterns I've included API Key under 'openai.py'.
Finally the code under 'bot.py' is responsible for the final output.
